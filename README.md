# Test-Automation-By-Junit

## Project Summary:
This project involves setting up a Java development environment, adding JUnit dependency, and creating test cases using the @Test annotation. The tests cover various aspects of the application, such as calculations, input validations, and business logic. The code under test is implemented in separate classes. Tests are executed to verify expected results and identify any failures. The project focuses on maintaining application reliability and enabling continuous integration and delivery practices.

## Key Features:

- Automated Testing: Implement automated tests using JUnit to verify the functionality and behavior of the Java application.
- Assertions: Utilize JUnit's assertion methods, such as assertEquals or assertTrue, to compare actual results with expected results.
- Test Coverage: Design test cases to cover a wide range of scenarios, including normal cases, edge cases, and error conditions, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.
- Reporting and Analysis: Gather and analyze test results, identifying failures and providing insights for further improvements in the application's quality and stability.
